Which is Best for You?", "date_published": "Jan 20, 2023", "content": "If you\u2019re interested in embarking on a career in tech, it is likely that you have taken a look into two learning paths: self-learning vs. coding bootcamps. But what are the differences? Many online institutions offer self-learning courses. This is becoming increasingly popular as students are becoming more aware of their individual learning styles, and value flexibility and self-paced programs. Coding bootcamps have a reputation for being the accelerated path to launching a career in tech. This tends to work best for students that thrive off of structured learning, with a support team to assist throughout the process. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages, but selecting which path is the correct choice for you should be based on your learning style and life circumstances. Codeup is the first, and currently the only accredited* coding bootcamp in Texas. Our program offerings range from 15 to 20 weeks and include: Full-Stack Web Development, Data Science and Cloud Administration.
